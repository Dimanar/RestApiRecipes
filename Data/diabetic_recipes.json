You can make it more attractive by serving it with a thin slice of lemon on top and a sprinkle of chopped parsley or chives. \n", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F62702.jpg", "meta": [["prep:", "5 mins"], ["cook:", "30 mins"], ["total:", "35 mins"], ["Servings:", "8"], ["Yield:", "8 servings"]], "ingredients": ["2 cups dry lentils", "2 quarts chicken broth", "1  onion, diced", "\u00bc cup tomato paste", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon ground cumin"], "direction": ["In a large saucepan combine lentils, broth, onion, tomato paste, garlic and cumin.
