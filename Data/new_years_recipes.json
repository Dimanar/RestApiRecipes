Traditionally, my family serves pork and sauerkraut every New Year's Day for luck in the coming year. I love cabbage as a general rule and like most sauerkraut recipes, but they can be quite sour depending on how it is prepared. Sadly I don't remember who gave me this recipe and who deserves the credit, since it was pulled from a collection of hand-written recipes I've kept for years. I made it as a side dish for New Year's Day dinner and it was a complete hit! This is certainly not your typical 'sour' sauerkraut recipe. \n", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F960982.jpg", "meta": [["prep:", "15 mins"], ["cook:", "35 mins"], ["total:", "50 mins"], ["Servings:", "8"], ["Yield:", "8 servings"]], "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon bacon drippings", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "2 (16 ounce) packages sauerkraut, undrained", "1 tablespoon packed brown sugar", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "\u00bd cup chicken stock", "\u00bd cup cooking sherry"], "direction": ["Heat bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.", "Place sauerkraut with juice into a large bowl and cover with water.
