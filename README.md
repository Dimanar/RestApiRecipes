With repository for my mobile application "Rare Chef-cooker".
All data I have taken from website https://www.allrecipes.com.

It`s only first version of api, in the future i am going to upgrade. 
From now this rest api can send a recipes by id or name, or group by types, or packages.

***WOKRS ONLY AT LOCAL MACHINE(it is temporary)***
PLEASE, be polite with my code. This is my first try to write rest api.
